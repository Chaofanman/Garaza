        <p class="justify">We are interested in both  web and mobile development using modern technologies integrating  one or more of the following fields in addition to Software Engineering: data science, data mining, and  machine learning. We believe learning and having experience in these fields are what can separate us from other developers in the real world. Our plan as a group to achieve our goal is to communicate extensively, work cohesively, and behave professionally.</p>

		<p><strong>First Week</strong></p>
		<p>In the first week, we sent our mockups to our client for review and did a dummy user sign up and login. Since it was a dummy sign up and login, we first used sqlite3 as a database. We used an MD5 hashing function for the passwords. We also deployed this on Heroku  for testing and as a foundation for the future. </p>
		<p><strong>Second Week</strong></p>
    	<p>In the second week, our client finalized our mockups. A lot of time was spent modularizing the database, tables, and their associations. We also rewrote our sign up via email and login to match the individual consultant fields; passwords were still hashed using an MD5 hashing function. We also moved to a postgres database for future proofing. </p>
    	<p><strong>Third Week</strong></p>
    	<p>For the third week we focused on finishing all front end elements. This is the biggest part of the first module and we plan on finishing this the next few weeks. Most of our groups efforts would be directed here for now.</p>

		<h4>Test Cases</h4>
		<p>Currently we have been testing the login system back end by inputting invalid and valid inputs and checking if they would output the desired results. We will also begin to test the sql injection counter-measures we have in place. </p>
		<p>We have been testing page navigation as well making sure we are being taken to the right pages.</p>
