Project Goals:
     We are interested in both  web and mobile development using modern technologies integrating  one or more of the following fields on top of Software Engineering: data science, data mining, and  machine learning. We believe learning and having experience in these fields are what can separate us from other developers in the real world. Our plan as a group to achieve this goal is to communicate extensively, work cohesively, and behave professionally.
