        <p class="justify">We are interested in both  web and mobile development using modern technologies integrating  one or more of the following fields in addition to Software Engineering: data science, data mining, and  machine learning. We believe learning and having experience in these fields are what can separate us from other developers in the real world. Our plan as a group to achieve our goal is to communicate extensively, work cohesively, and behave professionally.</p>

            <p>We have completed the mockups needed for the Islamic Development Bank's web application, however, we were instructed not to release them publicly. Currently the team is finishing up a Udemy course, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-sapui5/">"Learn SAPUI5 Professional Development"</a>, taught by the CTO at UI5CN, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/ajaynayak8/">Ajay Nayak.</a> Specifics of the server side technology to be used is still being discussed; We are looking at SAP Hana. Our first deadline with the bank is due in March.</p>

		<p><strong>First Week</strong></p>
		<p>In the first week, we sent our mockups to our client for review and did a dummy user sign up and login. Since it was a dummy sign up and login, we first used sqlite3 as a database. We used an MD5 hashing function for the passwords. We also deployed this on Heroku  for testing and as a foundation for the future. </p>
		<p><strong>Second Week</strong></p>
    	<p>In the second week, our client finalized our mockups. A lot of time was spent modularizing the database, tables, and their associations. We also rewrote our sign up via email and login to match the individual consultant fields; passwords were still hashed using an MD5 hashing function. We also moved to a postgres database for future proofing. </p>
    	<p><strong>Third Week</strong></p>
    	<p>For the third week we focused on finishing all front end elements. This is the biggest part of the first module and we plan on finishing this the next few weeks. Most of our groups efforts would be directed here for now.</p>
    	<p><strong>Fourth Week</strong></p>
    	<p>We have made good progress in the the front end pages. Some of them are completed while others have the barebones markup. We've had trouble sending the different kinds of requests to the server since OpenUI5 handles data binding differently. This week we will focus on the requests to the back end server and connecting it to the front end fields to make the page more dynamic. Refactoring of the back end is needed since the page to edit and sign up will be one big page so the data should be sent as a single request as opposed to separate ones.</p>
    	<p>After some talks with out client, we both agreed that switching our views from javascript to xml would be the best move going forward. Most exampled on the sapui5.explored website were in xml and it was difficult having to translate that code into js. Since we are now using xml as well it would be easier for us to follow the examples since translation is no longer required. However we had to redo all of our current views which would set us back a little.</p>
    	<p><strong>Fifth Week</strong></p>
    	<p>We're now about halfway done with all of the front end views we need to do. We have started to work on connecting the database with our frontend since we have currently just been using locally stored data. Along with this, we will start working on user authentication, giving different accounts different restrictions on what they can or cannot do.</p>
		<p><strong>Sixth Week</strong></p>
		<p>This week we were able to successfullly send RESTful requests to the live Heroku server in the SAP client code. The consultant page markup and design is done and the EOI page is almost as well. We are working on making the page's content to be more dynamic through the RESTful requests. In the backend, we have started the filtering and querying the users through sectors, expertise, and employment. We also need to change the edit page as one big request as opposed to separate requests by field. In the frontend we are also doing the vendor page and the login page.</p>

		<h4>Test Cases</h4>
		<p>Currently we have been testing the login system back end by inputting invalid and valid inputs and checking if they would output the desired results. We will also begin to test the sql injection counter-measures we have in place. </p>
		<p>We have been testing page navigation as well making sure we are being taken to the right pages.</p>
		<p>Ex. Input: Admin, AdminPassword<br />
		Expected Output: Succesful Login, redirected to account page<br />
		Actual Output: Succesful Login, redirected to account page<br />
		Input: FakeAccount, FakePassword<br />
		Expected Output: Failed Login, redirected to login page<br />
		Actual Output: Failed Login, redirected to login page<br />
		Input: F@44#__-=+, **43@@-1<br />
		Expected Output: Failed Login(invalid characters), redirected to login page<br />
		Actual Output: Failed Login(invalid characters), redirected to login page<br /></p>
